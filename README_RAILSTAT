== Installation

1. Create database
2. Create the database schema using rake db:migrate
3. Download the IP-to-Country database from http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/ :

   wget http://ip-to-country.webhosting.info/downloads/ip-to-country.csv.zip
   unzip ip-to-country.csv.zip

4. Copy ip-to-country.csv in db/ directory
5. Upload the data using ip-to-country.mysql.sql:

   mysql -u _user_ _dbname_ < ip-to-country.mysql.sql

6. Add your web site name at the end of config/environment.rb (assign it to a constant SITE_NAME)
   
   Example:
   SITE_NAME = 'www.mydomain.com'

Notes: Steps 3 - 5 are optional. If you don't want to download ip-to-country database 
       the system will work but the visitor country will not be tracked.
